## 🧠 What I’m into

- Cryptographic AI  -  FHE, zkML, verifiable inference, agent systems  
- Web3 infrastructure  -  nodes, validators, onchain automation  
- Research to content  -  turning complex papers and docs into clear threads, guides and explainers  
- AI-native protocols  -  Ritual, Zama, Gensyn, Symbiotic, Rialo, Reya and others

I like to break things down, experiment on testnets, and share everything I learn with the community.
